# BrilloSolutions_HTU21D_Breakout_Arduino_Library
This is an Arduino library for HTU21D digital Humidity and Temperature Sensor. 
It supports all sensor features like Soft Reset, reads Humidity, reads Temperature, reads Battery Alert/Status.
After reading temperature and humidity, user can also calculate dew point and partial pressure as already shown in example test code.
