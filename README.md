# BrilloSolutions_HTU21D_Breakout_Arduino_Library
This is an Arduino library for HTU21D digital Humidity and Temperature Sensor. 
It supports all sensor features like Soft Reset, reads Humidity, reads Temperature, reads Battery Alert/Status.
After reading temperature and humidity, user can also calculate dew point and partial pressure as already shown in example test code.
This library has been written by following the datasheet of HTU21D sensor.
